NOTE TO SELF
1. Having 2 pointers (fast and slow) is a useful trick in many problems. Eg: middle of list, detect cycle, etc.
2. Having a sentinel node so that you can handle cases where the very first node is in question. Eg: remove a node etc.
3. Move all the pointers together. Dont do all even once and odd once kind of operation. That doesnt work! (eg: check https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/linked-list/219/classic-problems/1208/)
4. READ ALL COMMENTS IN THE CODE WHILE REVISING.
5. Check for nulls, edge cases and also check for breaking conditions always!!!
6. It is ok to take as many pointers as we need as long we are moving through the list only once.
