/**
 * single-source shortest path algorithm => it helps to find the shortest distance between a single source and all other nodes.
 * works both on directed and undirected graphs
 * works on non negative weighted graphs.
 * Its a greedy algo. similar to prim's algo
 * finding minimum spanning trees.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(E + Vlog V) when a Fibonacci heap is used, or O(V + E log V) for a Binary heap.
 * Space Complexity: O(V). We need to store V vertices in our data structure.
