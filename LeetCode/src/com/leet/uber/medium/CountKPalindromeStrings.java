/**
 * Idea is following: count of chars can be even or odd. Those that are even - they can be used in one of substrings to form the palindrome, so we don't care about those.
 * If character has odd frequency - it can be inserted only 1 or 3 or 5... etc. to form the palindrome. However number of such characters cannot be more than number of strings, in other words - only one such char is allowed per substring.
 * This leads to solution - count all frequencies, count those that are odd. If number of such chars > then k - it's not possible to balance it to form all palindromes.
 *
 * O(n) time - iterate over every char in string to count freq.
 * O(1) space - use fixed size array to count freq.
